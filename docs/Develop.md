This document provides links and points to the main information available to
potential LGraph developers.

As developer, you should become familiar with the [Usage](./Usage.md) guide. It
provides an intro to the basic commands and how to run LGraph.

LGraph uses bazel as build system, you may want to go over the
[Bazel](./Bazel.md) documentation to see basic bazel commands, and how to
run/compile/debug basic examples.

If you are going to create a new pass and/or inou project, the
[CreateInouPass](./CreateInouPass.md) provides an introduction on how to create
a pass and integrate it with lgshell.

[GitHub-use](GitHub-use.md) explains how to operated with git and LGraph, how to
handle branches, merges and the lack of submodules.
