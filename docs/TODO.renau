-How to annotate verilog.  Since we do not have verilog parser, to annotate:

 opt1: insert a cell (bbox) and traverse using it. Do a pass that removes? bbox
and annotates? or just keep bbox and treat as a "buffer"

 opt2: dump a text file with netlist and read after loading in lgraph

 opt3: modify parser in yosys (ufff)

-Capacity to json (or text?) dump/read the annotations. It could be used by scripts
(maybe include netlist name when possible)
