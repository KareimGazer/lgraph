Vectorize:

 -In the lgraph, combine operations to vector (and/or/...) whenever possible.

 -In the llvm variable generation, put bits located in memory close by so that a single load can handle the vector


profile/If-Conversion

 -Create if blocks no selects and insert edge profile.

 -If the profile sets a branch as highly misspredicted, then switch to selectinst (no branch)

 -Put infrequently taken basic blocks out of the execution path
