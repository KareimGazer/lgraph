-Detailed Router

 1st- Route top 10% most time critical nets. All over the design.

 2nd- Route all the 3+ aligned pins. If mesh topo, just pick 3+ aligned nets NS
or EW that have the lowest global route congestion.

 3rd- Divide block in zones. Each zone would be routed by itself. Pick zones so
that they can be solved with a SAT solver router (small enough). Stop zone
boundaries in blockages, or when the routing is easy (low global congestion).

 4th- Pick a zone as seed, and create a plan for zone propagation. E.g: in a
10x10 map, pic 4,4 as starting zone, then do (3,4) (4,5) (4,3) (4,5). Keep
expanding as a "flooding" from the seed. Each zone can be done in parallel. No
two parallel computed zones can have an edge still being computed.

 5th- For available spaces after routing, insert ground or Vdd shielding when possible.

 SAT Solver router:

 for each metal layer:
    -add all the nets and tracks overlaps in zone. If SAT,
  then it can be routed, pick a solution and route.

    -If unsat, keep removing clause from less critical nets in congested areas until
  the problem becomes SAT again.

    -Find minimum set of nets that need to be removed to be routable (SAT). Then fix
  the routes for these.

 The remaining nets can not be routed unless outside guidance is used

 For nets that point to point (not 3 points involved)

   -Split tracks in places were bias can be placed, and allow to route through
higher levels or U or C shape to avoid obstacles.

 For nets that have 3 or more points.

   -Do a maze route starting from network (not pin) to find a place to connect.
